## Demo

## Features
- Keyboard accessibility
- Page responsiveness (laptop, tablets, and mobile)
- Animations
- Celsius/Fahrenheit + kmh/mph feature parity
- Weather descriptions
## Future Considerations
- Dark Mode/Light Mode
- Location customization
- Wind speed icons
- Hover to expand for more weather information (precipitation levels, humidity, etc)
- Overall code clean up and tests

## Challenges

### Overall Development Process
- Prioritizing features
- Creativity vs. too much divergence from the Figma
- Time box
- Keeping code and commit history clean
- Rusty on React, never used Vite to set up a blank project before

### Responsiveness
- Stacking elements
- Keeping CSS clean / Trying to integrate Tailwind
- Animations (if they're necessary in mobile view)
- Aspect ratio of the city skyline

### API
- Fetching from the API within each component (how can I just do one call for the whole page?), since I worked in sections it was hard to conceptualize how to do it as a whole
- No built in functionality for temperature and wind speed unit conversions

## External Tools/Libraries
- React & Vite
- Node 
- Open-Meteo (Weather API)
- Tailwind CSS
- Bootstrap
